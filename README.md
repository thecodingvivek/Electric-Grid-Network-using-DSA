# Electric Grid Representation using Graphs

Welcome to the Electric Grid Representation Project! This isn't just another boring project about power distribution — it's a fun simulation of how electricity zooms through your city, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a sprinkle of Python as main skeleton. If you’re here, it’s probably because you’re a graph nerd, an electric enthusiast, or someone who accidentally clicked on this repo. No judgment!

# What's the Buzz? 

Ever wondered how electricity knows where to go? Neither do we! But we used graphs to figure it out anyway. Think of this as a simulation where each pole is a node, and the connections between them are edges. We optimize routes, reduce power loss, and make sure you’re not left in the dark.

#Tech Stack:

HTML & CSS: For making the UI look electrifyingly good.

JavaScript: The brains of the frontend. Connects your clicks to actions.

Python: Blue print of the project

Graphs: The unsung heroes. Directed, weighted, and ready to transmit electrons.
